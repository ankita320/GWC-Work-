    <p class= "para">The case Roe v Wade took place in 1973 which it was a 7-2 vote by the supreme court that women had the fundemental right to decide whether or not they will get an abortion without any government restrictions. Though this case was challenged throughout the past decades, it has never been overturned -- until recently. With the recent overturn, states now have the right to elimante and ban abortions which some states already have been doing, taking away that right from an woman. This ruling is not about the lives -- it's about power and control. That is why we need to fight back.

      <p class= "so">Why is this so important?</p>
<div class= "impo">
  <p class= "text"><strong>1.</strong> With this recent overturn, so many people's lives will be at risk  because they might go to an unsafe option (i.e.  clothing hanger) because they live in states where abortion is already being banned. By taking away this fundemental right,  many people's lives will be in danger. They deserve the right to choose. </p>
  
   <p class= "text"><strong>2.</strong> With this recent overturn, minorities are going to be most impacted. For instance, LGBTQ+ Community, people of low-income, immigrants, people of color are going to be most affected by the overturn.  It is for that individual to decide whether to get an abortion and the government can have no say.
   </p>
   <p class= "text"><strong>3. </strong>It is the  individual's descision to decide whether or not whether or why they choose to get an abortion. It should not be in the government's hands to decide what one can and cannot do with their bodies. With this overturn, the government is only taking power and control and that is why we have to take as much action as possible.</p>
</div>
    <div class= "impo2">
       <p class= "text"><strong>4. </strong>The reason one get's an abortion is nobody's but that person's business. Therefore, the government has no right to take that right away from people. Where abortion is illegal, women have to go through unwanted pregnancies -- self-inflicted bodily tramua and self-medication of drugs from unqualified abortion providers. 
       </p>
       <p class= "text"><strong>5. </strong>With these further restrictions on abortions and many states already banning them, it is so crucial that we stand up now. In order to protect abortion access and help people obtain them, we need to take action now by donating to abortion funds, or contact our local representatives.  </p>
